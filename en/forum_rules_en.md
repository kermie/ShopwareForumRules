## Welcome to the Shopware Community Forum!

Whether you're new and seeking guidance or have questions about setting up Shopware, you've come to the right place. We're a friendly community eager to assist. As you grow more familiar, we encourage you to share your knowledge and help others. To ensure a pleasant experience for all, we've established the following guidelines. Violations may result in reminders, edits, or removal of posts, and repeated offenses could lead to further action.

### 1. Registration and Account

1.1. Active participation requires registration. With a user account, you can post and engage in discussions within the forum.

1.2. Choose a respectful username and avatar. Ensure your avatar doesn't infringe on copyrights; be prepared to provide authorization if requested.

1.3. You may include a link to your personal website or online store. Avoid intrusive formatting, as the focus should remain on the content. Refrain from sharing personal information like phone numbers, email, or postal addresses in public posts.

1.4. Multiple accounts per user and shared group accounts are prohibited and will be removed.

### 2. Forum Conduct

2.1. Maintain open, courteous, and respectful interactions. Remember, there's a person behind every post whose feelings should be considered.

2.2. In this community, we prefer informal language to foster a friendly atmosphere.

2.3. Everyone starts somewhere. Be patient and supportive with newcomers. The quality of your assistance matters.

2.4. Limit private messages to moderators and administrators to issues unsuitable for public discussion. Support requests should be posted publicly; our team members are not personal service providers.

2.5. Pay attention to spelling and punctuation to ensure your posts are readable and understandable.

2.6. Use quotes sparingly. When replying to a recent post, avoid quoting the entire message.

2.7. Off-topic posts, repetitive content, and multiple postings of the same message across threads are discouraged.

2.8. Each topic should reside in a single thread. Posting the same content in different languages or sections doesn't expedite responses.

2.9. Before posting a new question, use the forum's search function. Many topics have been previously addressed. If you can't find a solution or if existing information is outdated, feel free to create a new thread.

2.10. Craft clear and descriptive titles without using all capital letters. Provide detailed information about your issue, including relevant system details, to facilitate accurate assistance.

2.11. Offer feedback when a suggested solution resolves your issue. This not only acknowledges the helper but also aids future forum visitors.

2.12. Overt advertising and solicitations for paid problem-solving outside the forum are discouraged. Moderators will assess the appropriateness based on user activity and context.

### 3. Legal Considerations and Posting Guidelines

3.1. Respect copyright, trademark, and naming rights. Do not post protected texts or images without proper authorization.

3.2. Uphold legal standards by avoiding violations of corporate and personal rights. Requests or discussions promoting unlawful activities are prohibited.

3.3. Do not publish private communications without the consent of all involved parties.

3.4. Refrain from making unapproved negative statements about individuals, companies, organizations, products, or services, as these could be considered defamatory and may have legal consequences.

3.5. Only include links to commercial sites if they are directly relevant to the discussion topic.

3.6. Offering used software licenses for sale is not permitted in this forum.
