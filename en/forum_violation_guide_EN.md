# Forum Rule Violation Guide

## When is a formal warning appropriate?

A formal warning (i.e., a clear, serious notice with the prospect of consequences) should be issued when a violation can no longer be considered a mere slip-up or when its impact is disruptive, offensive, or destructive.

Specific rule violations where a warning is appropriate:

1. Netiquette

In cases of repeated or particularly severe breaches of politeness, such as insults, sarcasm, or degrading behavior.

Quote: “Flaming, trolling, insults, personal attacks […] are prohibited.” → Especially in cases of repeated trolling or personal attacks: immediate warning.

2. Advertising & Self-Promotion

When users repeatedly post self-promotion or links to commercial offers without relevance. → A one-time mistake might receive a friendly reminder, but repetition warrants a warning.

3. Prohibited Content

Clear violations (e.g., racist or violent content, or copyrighted material) should be addressed immediately, without a preliminary reminder. Warning or immediate sanction.

4. Multiple Accounts

If a user intentionally uses multiple accounts to bypass rules, provoke, or fake support → immediate warning or suspension of the secondary account.

5. Disrespect Toward the Forum

If someone deliberately badmouths the forum or consistently undermines the moderation. → Critical feedback is welcome, but destructive behavior warrants a warning.

## Handling Rule Violations – Multi-Stage Procedure

A tiered approach is useful to remain fair yet firm. Here's a possible structure:

*Stage 1*: Friendly Reminder via Private Message (PM)

* Content: Brief info on the violated rule.
* Tone: Neutral, friendly, encouraging improvement.
* Goal: Give the user a chance to reflect.

*Stage 2*: Official Warning

* Content: Clear statement of the violation, optionally with quote/example.
* Tone: Firm but not aggressive.
* Mention of potential consequences in case of recurrence.

*Stage 3*: Temporary Suspension (e.g., 1 week)

* Applied after a repeated violation despite warning.
* Goal: Show serious consequences, but allow return.
* Suspension is communicated with reasoning.

*Stage 4*: Permanent Ban

* If the user shows no insight over time or continuously disturbs others.
* May be applied immediately in severe cases (e.g., racism, threats, etc.).

Bonus Tip: Transparent Moderation

A public "moderation thread" (read-only) with anonymized cases or general reminders (“We’d like to remind everyone that advertising is not allowed...”) can raise awareness without singling users out.
